# Overview of 5G

5G is short for **5th Generation** - a type of digital cellular network. It follows 2G, 3G, and 4G in respective order. Analog signals representing sounds and images are digitalized in the phone, converted by an analog digital converter and transmitted as a stream of bits. 5G will be able to support up to *a million devices per square kilometer*, while 4G only supports *4000 per square kilometer*. 5G will how faster connections, higher data transmission, and more capacity.

The first phase of 5G specifications is scheduled to complete in 2019, and the second phase is projected to be completed in 2020. But just as the market adapted to 4G, it will have to adapt to 5G. New 5G devices will be made that will support the new wireless system, along with being able to have 4G LTE capacity, in locations where 5G access is not available.
