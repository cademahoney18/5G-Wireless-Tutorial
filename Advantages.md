#Advantages of 5G

As smartphones and other digital devices get smarter and more numerous, the applications they run will continue to generate more and more data. To deal with this, 5G data transfer speeds are projected to be **10 times higher** than current 4G/LTE speeds, which means significantly faster transmission of images and videos. For instance, with 4G LTE - downloading a high definition movie might take about 10 minutes. But instead, with 5G - downloading the same movie would take less than a second.

Another benefit of the new 5G network will be shorter delays in data transfer. Though not always noticeable, there is often a brief lag in time from when data is sent to when it's received. 5G should reduce this latency, making it possible to watch high speed virtual reality video with no delays *or* glitches.

The last expected benefit of 5G would be increased connectivity. Which means more people - and more devices - should be able to communicate all at the same time.
