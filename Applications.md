#Applications of 5G

5G technology will power a wide range of future industries from retail to education, transportation to entertainment, and smart homes to healthcare. Researchers predict the global, social, and economic impact of 5G will benefit entire economies and societies.

55% of mobile internet traffic globally was used for video downloads in 2015. This trend will only continue to increase in the future and 5G can do more than just handle that. The entertainment industry will hugely benefit from these 5G wireless networks.
Not to mention the aspiration of the *Internet of Things*, or **IoT**. The IoT will connect every object, appliance, sensor, device, and application to the internet. And with all this connection, huge amounts of data will be collected in order for all this to continue to run smoothly. It will require the efficient network of 5G in order to power it

More applications we could look forward to include:
- Entire smart homes
- Smart cities
- Smart farming
- Improved medical devices
- Autonomous Driving
- More sophisticated drones
- Better security and surveillance

5G is one of the most sophisticated wireless technologies we have ever developed so far - It will revolutionize the entire area that is using it. The best is yet to come in this new age of wireless technology.
